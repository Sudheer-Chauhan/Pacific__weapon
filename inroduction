Germen Dagger 
The SS Dagger, also known as the "SS Ehrendolch" or "Himmler dagger," was a ceremonial dagger associated with the Schutzstaffel (SS) during the Nazi era. Here are some of the distinctive features of an SS Dagger:

1. Blade: The dagger featured a double-edged blade that was approximately 33 centimeters (13 inches) long. The blade had a symmetrical shape and a sharp point.

2. Crossguard: The crossguard of the SS Dagger had a unique design, featuring a stylized SS logo. The logo consisted of two lightning bolts in the shape of the letter "S," overlapping each other. This crossguard design was a distinguishing feature of the SS Dagger.

3. Handle: The handle of the SS Dagger was typically made of black or dark-colored wood. It had an elliptical shape, wider in the center and tapering towards the pommel. The handle was affixed to the tang of the dagger with two or three metal rivets.

4. SS Insignia: The grip of the SS Dagger prominently displayed the SS runic insignia. This symbol consisted of two lightning bolts in the shape of the letter "S" crossed over each other. The insignia was usually made of metal and placed on a black enamel background.

5. Pommel: The pommel of the SS Dagger resembled an eagle's head, with the beak pointing forward and the wings folded back. The eagle head was often made of metal, such as nickel or silver, and featured intricate detailing.

6. Scabbard: The scabbard of the SS Dagger was typically made of black-painted steel. It had a simple design and featured a single throat and chape. The scabbard was often decorated with metal fittings, including an upper and lower scabbard mount.

7. Engravings: Some SS Daggers had personalized engravings on the blade, near the crossguard. These engravings usually included the recipient's name or initials, as well as SS-related slogans or mottos.

It's worth mentioning that the SS Dagger was primarily a ceremonial weapon and a symbol of rank within the SS organization. The design and materials used in the production of these daggers varied over time, and certain variations are highly sought after by collectors today.

Pommel form: eagle head with working press stud, doubling as the creature's right eye, and full length T-shaped attachment slot. Stylised feathers are depicted in relief. Pommel meets grips vertically. 
Grips form: two-piece staghorn retained by two large dome-headed rivets. Underside of grips very slightly shaped to hand, back flat and straight. Pinned between the retaining rivets of the right grip is a white metal badge in the form of the Wehrmacht eagle surmounting a swastika enclosed by a small circular wreath. The eagle's wings rest upon an open oval oakleaf wreath. 
Crossguard form: lower guard formed into short backswept quillon with flared terminal. Upper guard, extending barely 2.5 mm above back of blade, is concave ground. Left and right sides, except for that section stamped with the unit mark, are adorned with oakleaves and acorns in low relief.
 Blade form: long, single-edged, spear point, fullered. Fullers start approximately 33 mm from crossguard and extend to blade tip. Bayonet finish: all metal parts chrome plated. (Related items: scabbard, belt frog and bayonet knot).
